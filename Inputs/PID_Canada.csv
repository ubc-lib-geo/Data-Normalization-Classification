On July 20, 2017 the coroner’s inquest into his killing by police was released and concluded incredibly that his death was accidental. Now for most reasonable people if a civilian pepper sprayed, beat, restrained, and stepped on someone and they died it would not be viewed as an accident. Death would be recognized as a probability outcome of those actions being inflicted on someone.</p> Wesley had gone to the nursing station, in the community 400 kilometers north of Thunder Bay, concerned about shortness of breath and looking for help. A nurse there viewed his behavior as erratic (one would think acting erratically is not atypical for someone in medical distress) and called Nishawbe-Aski police.</p> The two officers who arrived pepper sprayed Wesley, tackled him onto the floor, beat him with a baton, and handcuffed his hands behind him. With police forcing him face down on the floor and with their boots on his head, neck, and back, Wesley stopped breathing. The inquest determined this to be an accident but we might reasonable ask if he would have died in the absence of this police assault.</p> None of the medical staff at the nursing station, including the doctor and nurses, did anything to help Wesley, perhaps fearful of police response if they tried. They only checked on him after he stopped breathing.</p> The coroner’s inquest, in a manner not unique in cases of police killing civilians, decided to blame the victim in their ruling. They found the cause of Wesley’s death to be “struggle and restraint (chest compression, prone positioning, handcuffing) as well as agitation and trauma (pain)&#8230;.with acute alcohol withdrawal/delirium tremens.” Restraint, agitation, and trauma are all directly attributable to actions taken by the police officers. These were not accidents.</p> The jury made 53 recommendations. Some of them highlight systemic racism within government services in Indigenous communities (without actually naming racism). They include:</p> Cultural training courses for nurses before being placed in an Indigenous community.</p> Hiring medical staff and police officers who speak the language of the communities they serve.</p> Developing a protocol for police interventions in medical facilities within Indigenous communities.</p> Designating Nishnawbe-Aski Police Services as a police force under the Police Services Act in Ontario and thus providing for some civilian oversight.</p> &nbsp;</p> By all accounts Romeo Wesley was a beloved member of the community and is missed by many.

It also called for removal of any officer where performance or safety concerns are identified by supervisors.</p> After the killing, Luimes was charged with dangerous driving causing death but a judge decided there was not enough evidence to convict him. The state protects the state in such cases. At a disciplinary hearing Luimes was found guilty of discreditable conduct in the crash. Edmonton police Superintendent Brad Doucette and the investigating officer for the Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) were the only witnesses to testify at the inquiry on March 14, 2017.

Where they are charged it us usually for a lesser associated offense. Convictions for any offense related to killing civilians are obviously even less common. On January 27, 2017, a rare conviction of a killer cop was arrived at in a Québec court for a killing almost five years earlier. François Laurin, an officer with Sûreté du Québec, the provincial police force was found guilty of dangerous driving causing death in the killing of 25-year-old Éric Rompré.</p> Officer Laurin was responding to an emergency call on June 16, 2012 when his speeding vehicle slammed into another car on Highway 148 near Papineauville, Québec. The victim in the crash was Éric Rompré the driver of the car hit by Laurin. The officer was travelling at the extreme speed of 180 km/h when he crashed into the victim’s vehicle. Incredibly the dire matter of great public safety and security that had Laurin travelling at such dangerous speed was meeting a colleague on the force to help transport an intoxicated person at Rockfest in nearby Montebello. The Crown in the case questioned why Laurin felt the need to travel at such a high speed for a call of that banal nature.</p> Laurin’s lawyers tried a common, and often successful ploy, in cases where an officer is actually charged with an offense. They attempted to have the trial set aside because of delays between the filing of charges and the start of court proceedings. In the Canadian context prosecutors have seen the commencement of trials for police stalled leading to the dropping of charges.</p> ",Eric Rompre,475_KCC,Papineauville,Highway 148,,,,Yes,François Laurin,None,no,no,no,no,no,simple dangerous driving,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/sq-dangerous-driving-prison-1.4431907,0.8333333333333334,,,,,https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/2017/12/04/quebec-killer-cop-francois-laurin-sentenced-to-one-year-for-killing-eric-rompre/,960_KCC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The killer cop was granted bail by an appeal court judge the same day. Romano plans to appeal both the sentence and the conviction. Carla Abogado’s family left the appeal court in tears after Romano was granted permission to appeal.</p> Detective-Constable Romano killed 18-year-old Carla Abogado, striking her with his unmarked police truck at 115 km/h in a 60 km/ zone. She was crossing the street to go home after stepping off a bus at Warden Avenue and St. Clair Avenue East on February 12, 2014.</p> Romano was speeding to catch up with a police surveillance team after he had lagged behind. The court heard that the team was not in any danger or on an urgent case and the speeding by Romano was in no way necessary or justifiable.</p> This was the third time Romano has gone to trial for the killing. The first trial resulted in a deadlocked jury and in the second case Romano was found not guilty.</p> The judge in this third trial, Superior Court judge Brian O’Marra, went soft on Romano in sentencing, taking the perspective of the cop, as the courts often do. Judge O&#8217;Marra disagreed with the crown assessment that Romano had not shown remorse for the killing. Incredibly, Judge O’Marra called the crown’s request for a 12 month sentence “excessive.” This may be so only in terms of sentences for cops as the state will generally find ways to protect the state.</p> Romano is still employed by the York Regional Police and being paid by the public. The killer cop was placed on administrative duties following the criminal charge and the police service have confirmed that Romano will continue in those duties, pending the outcome of the appeal. Romano has taken the copaganda approach followed by many killer cops and their associations, and propped up by servile cop promoting criminologists, of claiming PTSD as a result of his killing someone.</p> Carla Abogado’s family had previously filed a $2.2-million lawsuit against the York Regional Police Service.

In addition to the eight-month sentence, Ouellet will also be banned from driving for 20 months.</p> Crown lawyer Geneviève Langlois said the sentence was intended to make a statement: “The incarceration sends a clear message to the police community regarding the criminal behavior adopted by police officers in the course of their duties.”</p> This is a curious statement given the shortness of the sentence and the fact that initially the Crown did not even press charges against Ouellet.

Killer cops are rarely charged in Canada. And when they are, they are typically acquitted, even in cases in which they have obviously acted in a dubious, reckless, or murderous manner.</p> Quebec City police officer Simon Beaulieu backed his police car over Guy Blouin on September 3, 2014, killing the 48-year-old. Beaulieu used this lethal force against Blouin for no other reason than a baseless suspicion that Blouin had stolen a bike. This was apparently a case of class-based police profiling of a working class person in a working class neighborhood. Blouin had, in fact purchased his bike. Officer Beaulieu was charged in October 2015 of criminal negligence and dangerous driving causing death after he struck and killed Blouin.</p> On Friday, January 12, 2018, killer cops Beaulieu was found not guilty on both counts by Quebec Court Judge René de la Sablonnière. A not surprising result, no matter how unjust.</p> De la Sablonnière said the elements of proof presented to him did not show without a reasonable doubt that Beaulieu&#8217;s actions that day were dangerous, despite the fact that he sped backwards the wrong way on a one way street and drove over a cyclist who had, in fact done nothing wrong and posed no threat to the public or the officer. The judge concluded: “This was a sad and unfortunate accident” (quoted in Page 2018). But actively driving backwards over someone on a bike is not an “accident.”</p> The judge reached his conclusion despite the fact that the Crown prosecutor&#8217;s expert witness was a Sûreté du Québec crime reconstruction expert (another cop) who testified the police cruiser was going 44 kilometers per hour when it struck Blouin. The judge simply decided to side with the defense version of events which posed the police cruiser’s speed at 22 kilometers per hour. Why side with defense (posing a self-interested estimate) against one provided by a police expert (usually believed unquestioningly in cases against civilians)? The answer is that the state is always predisposed to protect the state in cases of police harm to civilians, under even the most egregious circumstances.</p> Incredibly, De la Sablonnière said Beaulieu made sure the coast was clear before backing up. This despite that obvious case that it was not clear—as evidenced by the fact that <em>he ran Blouin over</em>. How could he have ensured the coast was clear? Then the judge blamed faulty ABS brakes, a scenario only raised by a defense promoted and provided witness. Said de la Sablonnière: “He could not foresee there was a problem with the brakes” (quoted in Page 2018). But why was he speeding backward toward someone on a bicycle anyway? That is the question.</p> Throughout his ruling De la Sablonnière repeated that in order for a person to be found guilty of criminal negligence, his actions had to be significantly out of step with what is considered to be normal behavior. But he made sure to stress that normal or expected behavior had to be considered differently for police officers than for civilians (see the contradiction there—normal defined as different for some).</p> Stuart Edwards, a member of a citizens&#8217; committee from the working class Saint-Roch neighborhood where the accident happened, pointed out that the reasoning behind the ruling is hard to accept (Page 2018). And clearly it is for anyone not ready to accept class-profiling of poor ad working class people or to treat police in a privileged manner within a legal system that otherwise brags of “equality before the law” (yes, we know that is a myth).</p> Said Edwards, from the committee formed in response to Blouin’s killing and who was present in court at each step in the trial: “That’s a judicial impunity for a policeman, because he’s a policeman. I don&#8217;t buy that. I’m personally disappointed. I don’t accept this — I think it’s wrong” (quoted in Page 2018).</p> As should we all. And Edwards noted that the committee is very much concerned with the effect the not guilty ruling will have in the community. It validates the exertion of lethal force by police against people in a poor and working class community under any circumstances and  with impunity.</p> The city’s “police brotherhood” confirmed that concern saying the court decision recognizes that society must give special consideration to police officers. That sounds a lot like a threat.</p> &nbsp;</p> Further Reading</p> Page, Julia. 2018. “Quebec City Police Officer Acquitted of All Charges in 2014 Death of Cyclist.” <em>CBC News</em> January 12. <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/verdict-police-officer-guy-blouin-trial-1.4483566"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/verdict-police-officer-guy-blouin-trial-1.4483566</a></p> ",Guy Blouin,1015_KCC,Quebec City,Saint-François Est Street,,,,Charged - Not Guilty,Simon Beaulieu,None,no,no,no,no,no,criminal negligence and dangerous driving causing death - not guilty,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/simon-beaulieu-defence-closing-arguments-1.4367741,0.8333333333333334,https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/2017/10/23/trial-for-killer-cop-simon-beaulieu-hears-cops-should-be-given-more-consideration-than-regular-citizens/,906_KCC,,,https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/2017/10/18/killer-cop-simon-beaulieu-and-the-policing-assumptions-that-take-lives/,888_KCC,https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/2017/10/13/trial-begins-for-killer-cop-simon-beaulieu-in-guy-blouin-killing/,881_KCC,https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/2015/08/19/killer-cop-simon-beaulieu-charged-in-death-of-cyclist-guy-boulin-quebec/,82_KCC,,,https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/2016/10/11/killer-cop-simon-beaulieu-to-stand-trial-for-killing-guy-blouin-in-2014-quebec-city/,326_KCC,,,,,,,,

This despite the fact that the ASIRT investigation found that the force did not follow the “specific protocols [which] were in place” for times when the man, who was known by police, was taken into police custody. According to the ASIRT ruling said “procedural errors” were made and the man was left unsupervised, which protocol said he should not have been “resulting in a sufficient amount of time to commit suicide” (ASIRT).</p> The man had been arrested on February 17, 2015, supposedly for intoxication and a complaint about his presence at a residence. So once again police were called to address a health care issue and the result is a civilian death.</p> ASIRT, which has an apparent habit of offering bogus excuses for officers and forces involved in civilian deaths, such as the dubious “excited delirium” claim, this time went one better. Their report attributed the man’s death to the vague and rather unscientific explanation of a “perfect storm” resulting in the man’s death. Surely this is clearly an ideological or copaganda mystification that excuses the officers involved for their own active choices and actions, the committing of procedural errors, and the role those played in contributing to the death. Yet the “perfect storm” means even a consideration of something like negligence is nullified. To the benefit of the police officers responsible.</p> ASIRT said in a statement that: “This case, however, should remind officers of the duty of care they undertake when exercising custody or control of another person” (ASIRT). Yet there is no mechanism to go beyond the occasional reminder when the investigative body keeps providing excuses to get cops off when civilians die in their custody.</p> Similarly,  in a statement, Chief Keith Blake of the TNPS said: “The Tsuut’ina Police remain absolutely committed to the highest levels of care for those persons in our care and custody” (Statement). Yet this case shows the lack of commitment to even basic standards of their own protocol.

It has been used by police forces as a way to simultaneously blame victims for their own killings and give killer cops an answer where no real answer exists.</p> This dubious piece of copaganda has been offered up once again in Alberta to excuse Edmonton Police Service officers who killed a 25-year-old man on April 29, 2015. This despite well established debunking of the notion of excited delirium. The Alberta Serious Incident Response Team (ASIRT) offered the excited delirium defense in findings released on April 18, 2017, two years after the young victim died after being subjected to force by multiple officers while in police custody.</p> Sadly, the victim was targeted by police for the trivial act of supposedly trespassing in the City Centre Mall after nervous security staff called them. The security staff had tweaked to him because they suspected him of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs. So an effort at moral regulation by private security ultimately resulted in a young man having his life taken by police. The ASIRT report added to the moral regulatory approach by suggesting the man had been uncooperative with police, saying he refused to follow directions.</p> For many police officers refusing to follow directions is an invitation to a beating or worse an extrajudicial execution. In this case ASIRT reports that at least four officers used force on the man supposedly to get him into restraints. After being violently removed from the mall and taken into Downtown Division the man was placed on the floor in the detention area. At this point Edmonton Police Services officers noticed he was unconscious, and in medical distress. Paramedics took the man to hospital but he could not be stabilized and was declared dead there.</p> Notably, the ASIRT reports makes clear that the man was acting in a way that suggested both to private security and police that his issue was health related not criminal. According to the ASIRT release the man “exhibited bizarre behaviour” (ASIRT). The report continues: “He was observed twisting and attempting to pull away. He was observed to be breathing heavily, mumbling and yelling, mostly incoherently” (ASIRT). Yet the intervention was, once again, repressive violence and thuggish force rather than health care.</p> This is a case in which private security and police intervene against someone who is, at most, dealing with substance abuse issues. Police should not be intervening in this situation. Yet they do so with force. And when force becomes lethal they turn to “excited delirium” in an attempt to justify the unjustifiable. And it routinely gets them off. And mainstream media repeat the claim uncritically.</p> &nbsp;</p> ",,570_KCC,Edmonton,10025 102A Ave NW,T5J 2Z2,,,No,,None,No,No,Yes,no,Methamphetamine,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/police-custody-death-drugs-excited-delirium-1.4075957,0.7083333333333333,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2015-09-15,MR_26,James,McIntosh,Christian,5.0,Male,White,BC,RCMP,Vehicle,Off-Duty/Retired,KillerCopsCanada,https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/2017/01/25/killer-cop-ace-stewart-receives-only-1500-fine-for-killing-5-year-old-james-mcintosh/ : https://infotel.ca/newsitem/police-officer-enters-guilty-plea-in-traffic-death-of-five-year-old-penticton-boy/it38918,"How much value does the criminal justice system place on the lives of people killed by police? The general answer is very little. The system that so easily and readily imposes itself on the lives of non-police charged with offenses is less ready to act when the offender is a cop. In the specific case of young victim James Christian McIntosh, only five when struck and killed by RCMP Constable Ace Stewart (49) on September 15, 2015 in Penticton, BC, the courts have determined the value of life at $1500. This is the decision of the court and Justice James Threlfall delivered on January 23, 2017. And this decision is clearly more about the killer being a police officer than any regard for equal application of justice.</p> Constable Ace Stewart drove into and killed James McIntosh in a proper crosswalk while the boy was out for a walk with his father and brother. Stewart did not slow down or stop his vehicle despite being aware that pedestrians on the street were urging him to do so. He claims he did not know what they meant so he ignored them. Until it was too late. He continued his vehicle even after striking the boy, running over him in the large pickup truck. James McIntosh sustained massive head injuries as a result.</p> The killing has been devastating for the McIntosh family. Father Brian who was walking with James and as a trained paramedic tried to save his son, has been diagnosed with PTSD. Brother Caleb has been deeply impacted. In the words of mother Elizabeth: “Not only is Caleb struggling with the loss of James, but having witnessed the accident and feeling somehow responsible because he couldn&#8217;t protect James has been a struggle for him” (quoted in Boyd 2017). According to Elizabeth McIntosh since the killing Caleb’s “existence has destabilized” (quoted in Arstad 2017).</p> In cases where police kill civilians there is invariably an effort in the courts, media, policing institutions, and among police supporters to portray the officer who killed as a victim as much as the person they killed. This played out in the trial of Ace Stewart. Neville McDougal, Stewart’s counsel claimed: “Everyone in this case is a victim” (quoted in Boyd 2017). Never mind that only one person is dead as a result of officer Ace Stewart’s actions, five-year-old James McIntosh.</p> The favor shown the RCMP constable is clear. According to the lawyer: “The cases clearly say, we are not sentencing you for causing death, we are sentencing you for your momentary inadvertence” (quoted in Mangione 2017). Incredibly the prosecutor, Crown counsel Peter Juk, told the court: “This is not the very worst driving, the very worst set of facts” (quoted in Fries 2017). This is how prosecutors treat police killings of civilians.</p> Interestingly it seems that officer Stewart’s macho cop identity may have played a role in this horrible situation. Crown counsel Juk noted in his submissions that the vehicle Stewart was driving when he hit James McIntosh, a 2015 Chevy Silverado, had been modified at the Chevrolet dealership to be lifted substantially. The truck was raised more than four inches over its original height. The truck also had wider than average tires. Stewart wanted to be seen as a tough guy on the road.</p> The judge used Stewart’s macho driving choices as a reason to justify the lenient court decision. According to Threlfall: “The increased height of Constable Stewart&#8217;s truck due to aftermarket modifications increased the truck&#8217;s blind spot area for objects immediately beside or in front of the truck 62 per cent over the original unmodified vehicle” (quoted in Boyd 2017). Yet while prosecutor Juk did argue Stewart’s obligation to drive more, rather than less, carefully given such known consequences of his modification of the truck, this did not seem to play into the judge’s decision. The judge did view the constable’s history of policing favorably in considering the sentence, of course.</p> Neither did evidence of Constable Ace Stewart’s extensive record of speeding offenses dating back to 1996. Here is another case of a police officer getting away with multiple violations over the course of decades with little to no consequence or accountability until finally these identifiable and documented activities finally lead to the death of a civilian. And even then, the result is a $1500 fine and Constable Ace Stewart is off to drive recklessly again.</p> The charge of driving a motor vehicle without care and attention under the Motor Vehicle Act could have carried a six-month sentence.</p> &nbsp;</p> Further Reading</p> Arstad, Steve. 2017. “Police Officer Enters Guilty Plea in Traffic Death of Five-Year-Old Penticton Boy.” <em>Infonews.ca</em>.

The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians has concluded that no criminal charges will be brought against an Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) officer in relation to the high speed police chase that resulted in the death of pedestrian Grace Glofcheskie in Guelph, Ontario in 2015. This despite the SIU investigation finding that the officer’s driving was “objectively dangerous” and his vehicle was in excess of 68 km/h over the posted speed limit at times during the chase.</p> The officer was pursuing an SUV whose driver was attempting to avoid a RIDE (drinking and driving) spot check on December 13, 2015. The chase went through Guelph’s downtown area. At its conclusion the SUV driver lost control, crossing onto a sidewalk and flipping. Grace Glofcheskie, who was walking home after visiting friends, was struck by the SUV. She was taken to hospital but died of her injuries. The SUV was later identified as stolen.</p> The SIU reported that it had assigned seven investigators, two forensic investigators, and one collision reconstructionist to the case. Six police officers and six civilians were interviewed for the investigation. The officer being investigated did not participate, nor did he provide a copy of his notes. This is a contentious part of SIU investigations, as police are legally allowed to withhold their notes, one which has been challenged by critics of the SIU and oversight procedures in Ontario.</p> There are some questions raised by the SIU report. Notably their conclusion not to bring any charges against the officer despite finding that his driving had been “objectively dangerous” in their words and the speeds of more than 68 km/h over the posted speed limit reached by the officer. The SIU explanation is also rather perplexing. It states: “However, the factual context does not allow me to conclude that the driving amounted to a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person in the same situation as the officer would have exercised in the circumstances” (SIU Release). It is hard to see how a civilian driving at such speeds over the posted limit and in an “objectively dangerous” manner would be viewed as so reasonable and would avoid charges. Indeed it is shown time and again that civilian drivers under less dangerous circumstances are charged.</p> ",Grace Glofcheskie,538_KCC,Guelph,Woolwich Street and Norfolk Street,,,,No,,None,No,No,No,No,No,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/grace-glofcheskie-curtis-henri-opp-officer-pursuit-charges-1.4038146,0.7916666666666666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the police pursuit the vehicle turned down a dirt road into trees, killing the 18-year-old male driver. A 16-year-old girl who was a passenger in the front seat was not seriously injured. The SIU report suggests that the speeding car was going 100 km on a stretch of road with speed limits varying between 50 km/h or 80 km/h when the officer saw it, and around 170 km/h when it left the road.</p> SIU director Tony Loparco, who has rather consistently sided with police officers and forces in cases of harm to civilian since assuming his position, did raise concerns about the officer&#8217;s speed, reporting that  the OPP vehicle reached 165 km/h, and about the fact that the officer did not immediately notify the dispatcher of the pursuit. According to Loparco, each of these may have constituted a breach of the Ontario Police Services Act.</p> Yet Loparco decided that the officer’s actions did not meet the bar either for dangerous driving or criminal negligence. In his words: “There is no evidence that the [officer’s] driving created a danger to other users of the roadway or that at any time he interfered with other traffic; additionally the environmental conditions were good and the roads were dry.”</p> This is a curious statement given that the teen driver was driving at speeds less than the officer reached at the time the officer began pursuit. So if even the officer’s higher speed and the road conditions did not pose a threat to the public, why pursue a joy riding teen driving at lower speeds under the same conditions?</p> Loparco went further, suggesting that there was no causal connection between the officer’s pursuit and the crash. In his words: “I am unable to establish that there was a causal connection between [the officer’s] actions&#8230;and the single-vehicle collision that caused the&#8230;death.” Yet the stated evidence appears to suggest the teen both sped up and turned off the road in response to the officer’s pursuit and the closing speed of that pursuit.</p> The SIU assigned eight investigators to the case.

Little is revealed about the circumstances of the deaths and too many questions are left unanswered. This is particularly the case in deaths of Indigenous people in police custody in Canada, occurrences which have been too frequent and too frequently passed over by media and academics alike.</p> Serious questions remain to be answered regarding the in custody death of Jocelyn Nynah Marsha George (18), a member of the Ahousaht and Hesquiaht First Nations, on the evening of June 24, 2016. The young Indigenous woman died while being held by the RCMP in Port Alberni. She had been arrested on June 23 for uncertain reasons. The BC Coroners Service reported that George was taken to Westcoast General Hospital the next morning “in need of medical attention” of an undisclosed nature. She was then taken by air ambulance to Victoria&#8217;s Royal Jubilee Hospital and died there on the evening of June 24. The Independent Investigations Office (IIO), which investigates all incidents of violence by police against civilians in British Columbia, are investigating.</p> Jocelyn George’s family members want to know why their loved one was left alone in the cell by RCMP and for how long. They also want to know if or when officers checked on her while she was being held. They would also like to see any video footage from the detachment (Zussman 2016b).</p> The family reports that Jocelyn George was taken into custody for a “disturbance” and was left alone in her cell. This raises real questions about police interactions with indigenous people, particularly indigenous youth. It is well documented that Indigenous people are responded to more punitively by police and are detained disproportionately to non-Natives in Canada (see Monchalin 2016). That Jocelyn George was taken into custody over a disturbance should raise flags about issues of police discretion, possible racism or profiling, and punitive policing.</p> Doctors at the hospital stated that they found a mix of drugs and alcohol in the teenager’s system which may have damaged internal organs. There is no sense yet why the police did not provide care and attention to someone who may have been experiencing distressed health. The family wants the IIO investigation to place focus on the ways in which police officers treat people dealing with addictions and health issues while in custody (Zussman 2016b). She apparently needed help but did not receive it.</p> George’s uncle Linus Lucas notes the ongoing impact of state violence and the residential school system on the family. These are the histories of Canadian colonialism and genocide that have devastated Indigenous communities and families and in which the RCMP were, and continue to be, central figures. This further informs questions about the lack of attention, care, or compassion George received while in custody. According to Lucas:</p> “In some ways I’m saying it’s not surprising where she ended up, given our own family history. Both my parents are survivors of residential schools. You only know how to deal with things in one manner, and that’s get angry and say what the hell is wrong with you, get your act together, and you are yelling..It just got her more determined to say, ‘I don&#8217;t have to deal with you and I will do what I want, just leave me alone,’ and it just got harder and harder for us to deal with.” (quoted in Zussman 2016b)</p> Two young children, four months and three years old, are left without their mother. She is fondly remembered by family members who recall a sweet girl. According to Christopher Cenmane, the father of her four-month-old daughter: “She was too young to say goodbye. I will always love her. I will always have her living in my heart. She is young, beautiful, smart. She will always be my love” (quoted in CBC 2016).</p> Incredibly, but in manner too common in cases of police involved deaths of civilians, the family was not even notified by police that their loved one had been taken to hospital. The family reports that they would not have known at all about the situation if an Indigenous hospital worker had not called to tell them (Zussman 2016b).</p> In the words of the victim’s cousin Lee Lucas: “We know she was brought in and they said she was okay, and she was found in the morning. Our main concern is to find out what happened in the time between when she was arrested and when the ambulance picked her up” (quoted in Zussman 2016a).</p> The family hopes the investigation will address police protocols for interacting with people dealing with addictions and/or health care issues. According to Lee Lucas: “If things can change from this, if cop protocols can change from this when they bring someone in who has issues like this&#8230;You have got to look at how they are brought in and why they are not checked out” (quoted in Zussman 2016a). Again questions remain to be asked why police are taking custody of people in health crises and why alternative care and support are not made available rather than police and detention. And why are police allowed to impose penalty and punishment in these cases in any event?</p> Jocelyn George’s cousin further points out that such punitive policing is especially deployed against Indigenous people and it is taking a brutal toll. In her words: “Sometimes things have to change because this is happening far too much especially for our people in this province” (quoted in Zussman 2016a).

Yet more and more policing is carried out by private forces, especially security guard services. And like the state policing forces their members kill. Yet private security is largely unregulated in Canada and have much leeway to act in unaccountable and largely unreported ways.</p> An Edmonton security guard, Sheldon Russell Bentley (35) is currently seeking bail after being charged with manslaughter and robbery for kicking an Edmonton man, Donald Doucette (51), to death and then robbing him.. Doucette, a culinary chef, was found in an alley next to the Lucky 97 grocery store in the afternoon of July 31, 2016. An autopsy showed Doucette died of blunt abdominal trauma.</p> Doucette had apparently passed out in the alley in before being approached by two security guards, one of whom was Sheldon Bentley. The charges claim Bentley kicked the passed out victim and stole $20 from him. The guards then simply went back to work.</p> Doucette&#8217;s has been struggling with alcohol for some time, a problem that family members say began in response to the death of his own father. He had been going to Alcoholics Anonymous as well as starting a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. In addition Doucette struggled with epilepsy. His family often worried that that he would fall down and have a seizure in a non-supportive environment.</p> Security guards exist only to protect private property and profits. They have no special mandate to act in public space.</p> As a range of private security forces take over urban space (from security guards to business association “ambassadors”) more attention must be given to them. And their actions must be increasingly observed and challenged. Some have taken to Cop Watch like counter-patrols of security guards and private security.</p> ",Sheldon Russel Bentley,534_KCC,Edmonton,10725 97 St NW,T5H 2L9,,,Yes,Sheldon Bentley,None,NO,NO,No,No,No,manslaughter - 4 years,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/sheldon-bentley-manslaughter-robbery-donald-doucette-1.4707034 ; https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/edmonton-involuntary-celibacy-sheldon-bentley-manslaughter-jail-1.4803943,0.9166666666666666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This includes not even reporting those harms.</p> In September of 2016 a Hamilton police officer was involved in a vehicular pursuit that killed 20-year-old motorcyclist Chokha Bayez. Yet the Hamilton police broke the law and never reported the killing by the officer to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) as they are required to do. Every police service in Ontario is legally mandated to notify the SIU immediately of any incidents of serious injury, allegations of sexual assault, or death involving their officers (Carter 2017).</p> An SIU investigation into the Hamilton police killing of Bayez was only initiated when the victim’s family contacted the unit a month after the crash. This is an unacceptable delay that further serves to interfere with any proper investigation. As judge Michael Tulloch put it is his report on oversight in Ontario: ”In most cases, the SIU depends on the police notifying it of incidents within its mandate. Prompt, thorough police notification is the starting point for effective, efficient SIU investigations. If the police take too long to notify the SIU of an incident, or fail to do so at all, any investigation may be compromised and justice may not ever be done” (quoted in Carter 2017).</p> Furthermore, the investigation is not even listed on a Hamilton police report of SIU investigations presented to the police board earlier in April 2017 (Carter 2017). Constable Steve Welton told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) that the incident was included (despite saying he could not comment on the case and failure to report to the SIU). Oddly, according to the CBC, no vehicular death can be found in the police board report (Carter 2017). CBC News only became aware of the SIU investigation as a result of a freedom of information request listing all of the SIU&#8217;s investigations into Hamilton police officers from 2016 (Carter 2017).</p> As we have documented consistently in this project there is no proper independent oversight of police and no mechanism is used, legal or otherwise, to ensure there are any negative consequences for officers and police forces who fail to comply with investigative policy and requirements. Even where they violate or flaunt the law.</p> SIU spokesperson Monica Hudon told CBC News: “If the SIU Director is of the view that there may have been a breach of the regulation, and no charges are laid, it has been the Director&#8217;s practice to notify the Chief/Commissioner of his concerns in order that they may be reviewed” (quoted in Carter 2017). Of course the chief is under no obligation to act and it is unsure if such notice has even been given in this case.</p> André Marin, a former Ontario ombudsman and past SIU director, is clear in stating that under current conditions there is nothing to stop police from acting like this whenever they so choose. In his words: “Because there are no consequences, police can be extremely lax. They have proven themselves to be ungovernable” (quoted in Carter 2017).</p> Marin has a stark assessment of police services boards as well. In his view, while they could push for oversight:  “Police services boards should be vigilant and hold their feet to the fire — but they don’t care either. There is absolutely no excuse for this” (quoted in Carter 2017).</p> Again, the police are a law unto themselves. And the state always protects the state.</p> &nbsp;</p> Further Reading</p> Carter, Adam. 2017. “Hamilton Police Broke the Law and there were No Consequences.” <em>CBC News</em>.

The crash occurred on September 13, 2016. The victim was one of five people, including another woman, two men, one of whom was the driver, and a 17-year-old boy, who were in the silver van that crashed following initiation of police pursuit. The four other occupants of the van are in stable condition in local hospital. The driver of the pickup truck was also in hospital in stable condition.</p> According to Winnipeg police spokesperson Constable Rob Carver, whose statements have not been independently confirmed: “The incident appears to have started when a general patrol unit in the area observed the vehicle with five individuals in it and decided that there was a reason to initiate a traffic stop. Overhead lights were activated and … the vehicle immediately fled and collided with the half-ton” (quoted in CBC News 2016). Curiously Carver went on to suggest that “[w]hile it is a pursuit by a technical definition, we did not actually apparently pursue the vehicle” (quoted in CBC News 2016). However, a short pursuit is still actually apparently a pursuit nonetheless. And in this case one with fatal consequences. No other details have been released by police or independent witnesses. Police have not revealed why they decided to pursue the vehicle in the first place.</p> The Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba, which examines all incidents of harm to civilians by on-duty and off-duty officers in Manitoba, is investigating this incident which resulted in the death of the woman passenger.

Upon encountering the man, shortly after arrival on scene, police fired several shots, killing the man.</p> Later that same night, at about 9:45 PM, the Eeyou Eenou Police in Chirasibi, a Cree community in northern Québec were dispatched on a call about an 18-year-old youth spotted outside his home apparently with a gun. While officers engaged the man he supposedly shot himself.</p> Monday night, October 3, SQ in Rouyn-Noranda responded to a call concerning a naked man apparently showing some distress but in front of his own home. Police, for undisclosed reasons, decided to subdue the man using pepper spray, which is well known to cause panic and agitation rather than quiet compliance. The police then moved to the brutal measure of batons. Clearly a curious choice for interacting with a distressed naked person at his own house, posing no threat to the public. The man died during the assault by police due to as yet unreleased causes.</p> The Bureau des enquêtes indépendentes du Quebec (BEI), the new agency that examines all cases of police harm to civilians in the province, has deployed 18 investigators to examine the three killings over 24 hours in early October. The bureau has already investigated eight fatal events, police killing civilians, since becoming operational only in June 2016.</p> &nbsp;</p> Québec Police Killing People in Distress</p> A 2015 study led by Annie Gendron, of the École nationale de police du Québec looked at 143 investigations carried out between 2006 and 2010 involving police harm to civilians at the request of the Québec Public Security Department. The study found that around 80 percent of cases requiring investigation where police harmed or killed civilians involved victims “in an altered state of consciousness” (Feith 2016). These were said by police to involve either mental health issues or intoxication, which were lumped together, or a combination of both.</p> Most of the interactions with police were notably of only short duration suggesting little time was taken to communicate, assess needs, or provide some form of care. Police do not engage in dialogue and do not make hospital referrals in enough cases. Often police seem to have a mistaken understanding about the nature of the call according to the Québec study. And they lack proper training.</p> To its great discredit the study suggested that one in four of the cases was “suicide by cop” an unsubstantiated, generally dismissed explanation that has no scientific basis and is typically used by police to justify their killings of civilians under dubious circumstances. The fact that someone would reasonably expect police to kill them as an outcome of a call for help and assistance perhaps speaks volumes.</p> Smaller departments claim not to have enough resources to provide basic mental health training for officers. Police interventions against people in mental health distress has become the neoliberal form of mental health care in Canada as mental health resources and services have been cut at the same time as police budgets are increased.</p> &nbsp;</p> Further Reading</p> Feith, Jesse. 2016. “Spate of Fatal Incidents Sparks Investigations by Quebec’s Police-Oversight Bureau.” <em>Montreal Gazette</em>.

An inquest into the death that was scheduled to take begin March 5, 2018, and which family hoped would provide some answers, has now been postponed until June 25.</p> The questions surrounding Lafond’s death are more pressing given that police initially suggested the injuries that led to Lafond’s death were inflicted in a vehicular crash and did not report that an officer used his knee to subdue the young man when he was handcuffed.</p> It has been reported publicly that Jordan Lafond died after the stolen truck he was a passenger in crashed into a fence on the outskirts of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in the early morning hours of October 23, 2016. Lafond was taken into custody and later died in hospital. Police have not been forthcoming on their role in Lafond’s death and what they did to him during the arrest.</p> A six-person jury, five women and one-man, was selected on Monday. Four of the jurors are Indigenous. Three were selected from a special jury pool of Indigenous people and one who self-identified. The request for Indigenous jurors can be made at inquests but not for criminal trials, an issue that has received great attention following the recent not guilty verdicts in the killings of Indigenous youth Colten Boushie and Tina Fontaine. The inquest is strictly a fact finding exercise and cannot assign blame or lead to charges being laid.</p> Grace Lafond-Barr, Jordan’s grandmother expressed the family’s grief: “Emotions have been up and down. A lot of tears, a lot of anger, a lot of sadness. Because we don’t know what happened to Jordan” (quoted in Hamilton 2018). She noted that police were not honest in reporting their actions during Jordan Lafond’s arrest. In her words: “We didn’t hear the truth when we were told of Jordan’s injuries. It would be nice to know what happened to him” (quoted in Hamilton 2018).</p> Police changed their story about what happened a few weeks after Lafond died. They had initially claimed that Lafond was found underneath a tire of the truck that crashed and said at that time that he died of injuries resulting from that crash. Then-police Chief Clive Weighill alleged that officers believed Lafond was resisting arrest and acknowledged that an officer used his knee to subdue Lafond and that he was handcuffed. Police have not admitted what part that might have played in the death.</p> Police even had to downgrade the initial charge of dangerous driving causing death laid against the driver of the stolen truck. Said the Crown prosecutor at the time: “We weren’t in a position to prove that the accident—or the collision, in this case—caused the death” (quoted in Hamilton 2018).</p> Saskatoon Police Service released a statement on March 5 saying that  they had carried out an internal investigation into Lafond’s death but would not release any details or results. There is no police oversight body, independent or otherwise, in Saskatchewan. The officer responsible is still on regular duties.</p> Jordan Lafond was a new father and worked at a roofing company to support her. Said Lafond-Barr: “Yes maybe he was in a stolen vehicle. But that doesn’t mean you should end his life over it. That’s what I said. I would like to bring some humanity to this (quoted in Hamilton 2018).</p> Anyone following events in Saskatchewan will note that young Indigenous men have been killed in that province for as little as stepping foot on a farm claimed by a white settler, with the settler farmer getting off despite admitting to the killing. So being killed by police for being in a stolen vehicle would not be unlikely in that context. And the officer involved will likely not even be charged.

The BC Coroners Service reports that Wood was involved in a vehicular incident and was taken into custody and placed in a police cruiser on November 5, 2016. He apparently told an RCMP officer that he had chest and shoulder pain and an ambulance was called. Wood was transferred to the ambulance to be taken to hospital. At some point en route he exited the rear of the ambulance falling to the road and suffering a head injury. He dies two days later on November 7, 2016.</p> The inquest is mandatory because Wood was in the custody of a police officer at the time of his death. Regional coroner Donita Kuzma will be joined by a jury in hearing from witnesses in an attempt to establish the facts of Wood’s death.

Too many people taken into custody by RCMP, particularly in northern detachments do not leave again alive. Disconcertingly, many of the people arrested and detained in northern communities are targeted and picked up for nothing more than public intoxication. Disproportionately arrested and detention for public intoxication are imposed on poor people and Indigenous people at discretion of police. Unfortunately such a situation has happened once again in the norther city of Prince George as a man has died in custody during the early morning hours of November 21, 2016.</p> The victim was arrested earlier in the evening of the 20th for supposedly causing a disturbance while intoxicated. He arrested for public drunkenness and transported to the Prince George RCMP detachment. At around 2 AM the man was found unresponsive. Emergency Health Services were contacted and RCMP officers apparently initiated CPR.

Notably, the officer did not know one of the men was the suspect. In response to the officer’s actions the driver of the Nissan accelerated to try to get away, drove into an intersection, and collided head-on with a Honda, in which the two seniors were passengers. Investigators on scene later estimated that the Nissan was traveling 131 km/hr in a 50 km/hr zone before the collision.</p> The 94-year-old became unresponsive at the scene before paramedics arrived and was pronounced dead at hospital. The 71-year-old passenger suffered a broken sternum, a broken bone in her back, and two broken bones in her left hand.</p> The SIU reports that it was only after the driver was arrested that he realized it was the assault suspect. That raises questions about why the officer undertook the actions taken. As well it might have been assumed that the lights and sirens would provoke a response as the car was leaving a residence and it was not a routine traffic stop. The SIU did conclude that it was the officer’s actions that led to the collision but still decided to let him off.</p> Said SIU director Tony Loparco in his report: “I find that there is no evidence that the [officer’s] driving created a danger to other users of the roadway.” But clearly his actions did create a danger to others in the roadway as one person was left dead and another badly injured as a result. According to Loparco, the officer “was concerned that might cause a situation dangerous to the public.” Which it obviously did.</p> ",,1047_KCC,Brantford,Gilkison St & Colborne St W,N3T 1Z7,,,n,,None,n,n,n,n,n,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/brantford-police-chase-1.3840224,0.7083333333333333,https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/2016/11/09/police-chase-results-in-crash-that-kills-94-year-old-woman-in-brantford-ontario/,380_KCC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 60 year-old native of Ethiopia was living at a home on St. Clarens Avenue, a Houselink home for people with mental health and addiction issues, when police killed her. Amleset Haile’s name has only been released publicly now. While the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency responsible for investigating cases of civilians harmed by police in Ontario, is investigating the killing it has not released her name.</p> Police arrived at the home near Bloor and Lansdowne Streets in west Toronto at 4:45 AM on January 2 in response to a report of an emotionally distraught woman threatening suicide. Only 15 minutes later, about 5 AM, Amleset Haile was wheeled out on a stretcher, not moving, her neck held in a brace. The woman would die two  days later in hospital after being taken off of life support.</p> Many questions remain unanswered in the month following her death at the hands of police. And family, friends, and neighbors want answers. Among the questions are why a home for people with mental health issues sis not have trained staff available to assist a distraught woman. Another question concerns why such a home would call police first rather than health care providers. Other questions involve what exactly police did to the woman and why and how did she sustain severe trauma to her body within 15 minutes of police activity. The SIU has not confirmed any police claims about the incident.</p> Friend Jennifer Cox witnessed part of the incident and believes Haile was in fear and running from police. She does not believe the frail woman was strong enough to lift herself up to jump from a window or balcony. Cox, like others, wonders if the situation involving her friend could have ended differently had a mental health caregiver  been called and responded instead of police.</p> The Toronto Police Department does have Mobile Crisis Intervention Teams (MCIT), roving units made up of a specially trained police officer and a mental-health nurse. Despite repeated recommendations and calls coming from coroner’s inquests these crisis teams are not available 24-hours a day. And none are available between 11 PM and 6 AM, what can be desperate overnight hours.</p> In the view of Steve Lurie, executive director of the Toronto branch of the Canadian Mental Health Association, there should be an expansion of hours of specialized mental health units. As he puts it: “If the call was ‘we think someone is suicidal,’ it makes more sense to bring mental health professionals to bear if they are available” (quoted in Gillis 2017).</p> On the whole far more resources should be put into independent mental health sources and resources in cities across Canada. Yet public funding is overwhelmingly given to police departments, at the expense of mental health care, harm reduction, support services, health care services for poor people, etc. Police departments continue to  make up the greatest part of city budgets while mental health funding and resources are slashed.</p> Amleset Haile is remembered by friends and the community organizations she was active in as generous, caring, and kind. She contributed to her communities through groups like Houselink and Sistering, a group for homeless and poor women in Toronto.</p> &nbsp;</p> Further Reading</p> Gillis, Wendy. 2017. “Friends Seek Answers as SIU Probes Death of 60-Year-Old Toronto Woman.” <em>Toronto Star</em>. <a href=""https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/02/20/friends-seek-answers-as-siu-probes-death-of-60-year-old-toronto-woman.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/02/20/friends-seek-answers-as-siu-probes-death-of-60-year-old-toronto-woman.html</a></p> ",,489_KCC,Toronto,Bloor and Lansdowne Streets,M6H 1P2,Ethiopian,Yes,TBD,,None,no,no,No,struggling with mental illness and dementia,no,TBD,https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/02/20/friends-seek-answers-as-siu-probes-death-of-60-year-old-toronto-woman.html,0.9166666666666666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 59-year-old Beaver struggled with mental health issues and those close to him want to know why he was being held in jail and not a health care facility. Jails in Canada are too often used by the state as holding centers for Indigenous people in need of health care not punishment, even well after health care issues have been identified.</p> Local Indigenous leaders, including Johnny Yellowhead, chief of the Nibinamik (Summer Beaver) band in northwestern Ontario, where Moses Beaver’s family lived has called for a full public examination into Beaver’s death and what might have been done to help him. He could not say why Beaver was in custody but reported that he had expressed concern about depression and blackouts.</p> In a prepared statement released Thursday, February 16, 2017, Grand Chief Alvin Fiddler of the Nishnawbe Aski First Nation said:</p> “The sudden and unexplained death of Moses Beaver was devastating to his family and everyone in Nibinamik. For Moses to die under these circumstances is troubling on so many levels, especially as his death has not been officially acknowledged by those responsible for his care. We are doing everything possible to support Chief and Council and the family of Moses Beaver, and we will demand an investigation into the circumstances around his passing.” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017b).</p> Said Chief Yellowhead: “Our dear friend Moses Beaver had struggled for many years with mental health issues but we do not understand why he was in custody or the circumstances that led to his death. It is clear that Moses needed professional help and a psychiatric assessment, and we demand to know why this didn’t happen” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017b).</p> Thunder Bay art gallery owner JP Fraser remembers the artists whose work his gallery has featured: “He was a very gentle person. He was a very warm, welcoming, outgoing and caring man. His painting skills will be a great loss to the artistic community. And what a waste of a life. He should have had treatment” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017a).</p> Fraser identified the Thunder Bay Jail as the wrong place to hold someone with mental illness (a fact clear to many except police it seems). In his view: “It is just not a place for someone with mental-health issues” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017a). One issue that emerges in city after city in Canada is that mental health services and funding are insufficient while police budgets continue to increase even as crime rates drop.</p> This point is emphasized by Johnny Yellowhead: “I wish there was better health care. He wanted to get better. He asked me to help” (quoted in Talaga and Edwards 2017a).</p> Thunder Bay Police and jail officials have refused to comment on either why Beaver was being held in custody or on the circumstances of his death. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Community Safety and Correctional Services confirmed that there was a death in the jail on Monday but would not say more.</p> The Thunder Bay Jail is already quite notorious in the Canadian context. It is the very facility where Indigenous youth Adam Capay (23) was held in solitary confinement for more than four years before public pressure pushed provincial authorities to change his conditions.</p> Moses Amik Beaver painted in the vivid Woodlands style associated with Ojibwe artist Norval Morrisseau. He was well known for his depictions of spirits and animals, painted in vivid colors and outlined in black. He was also very much appreciated for his work with children in local schools.</p> &nbsp;</p> Further Reading</p> Talaga, Tanya and Peter Edwards. 2017a. “First Nations Artist Dies in Thunder Bay Jail and Days Later Grieving Sister Killed in Car Crash.” <em>Toronto Star</em>.

The SIU reports police entered the house at around 7:00 AM and—huge jump here—a 52-year old man, since identified as Shawn Davis, was pronounced dead at the scene (killed?, found dead?, etc.?). No one is saying. But sudden death does not cut it.</p> CKPS Constable Kelly Helbin said police would not release any other information.

The driver of the pursued vehicle, a pickup truck, crashed into the vehicle being driven by Walsh with the truck bursting into flames. Walsh was declared dead at the scene. After the crash police told neighbors to evacuate their homes because of gasoline spilling out at the scene.</p> The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which examines harm to civilians by police in Ontario, is investigating the high-speed pursuit and how OPP officers responded to the situation. According to the SIU, police claim that at about 3:20 PM on September 25, 2017, the OPP responded to a call about a reportedly stolen vehicle in Eganville, around 130 kilometers west of Ottawa. The 20-year-old driver of the vehicle in question headed toward Arnprior on Highway 60, then to Highway 17, where the OPP began their pursuit. The truck collided with Welsh’s car a bit after 4 PM as she was pulling from her driveway on Daniel Street.</p> The SIU has assigned five investigators, two forensic investigators, and one collision reconstructionist to investigate the crash and the circumstances leading to it. None of the police claims have been independently confirmed. It is known that the risky and careless police decision to pursue enforcement of property rights has led to the death of a civilian.</p> One witness put it in clearly sensible term, In the words of Eric Bayley, a Bell Canada worker who observed the chase and crash while working:</p> &nbsp;</p> “The chase should never have happened. If the guy robbed a bank they would have got him sooner or later. It was a stolen vehicle. Big freakin’ deal. Now a poor grandmother, mother, sister is dead. There’s no … way in hell those cops should have been chasing them down that … road.” (quoted in Crawford and Gillis 2017)</p> &nbsp;</p> Continued Bayley:</p> “There had to have been eight cop cars and three Suburbans wide open going down Daniel Street. It could have been a lot worse. I was talking to my buddy on the phone and I was like, ‘Holy s—t. This is not going to go well.’ He said, ‘What’s going on?’ and I said, ‘There’s a high-speed chase. There’s cruiser after cruiser after cruiser.’” (quoted in Crawford and Gillis 2017)</p> &nbsp;</p> Indeed, a  flag worker on construction site the chase plowed through had to leap to safety.</p> Ontario’s Police Services Act sets out the rules governing police pursuits. According to the Act, police can pursue or continue pursuit “if the police officer has reason to believe that a criminal offence has been committed or is about to be committed; or for the purposes of motor vehicle identification or the identification of an individual in the vehicle.” The Act also further states police must continually weigh whether “the immediate need to apprehend an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle or the need to identify the fleeing motor vehicle or an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle outweighs the risk to public safety that may result from the pursuit.” Dispatch must be notified of the pursuit and the (Crawford and Gillis 2017).</p> &nbsp;</p> Further Reading</p> Crawford, Blair and Megan Gillis. 2017. “Eganville Man Faces  Charges After Woman Killed in Crash During Police Chase.” <em>Ottawa Citizen </em>September 27.  http://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/witness-describes-devastating-and-deadly-arnprior-crash</p> ",Sheila Walsh,848_KCC,Arnprior,Highway 17,,,,no,,None,no,no,no,no,no,,https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/i-dont-really-care-who-gets-killed-siu-report-details-fatal-2017-crash-in-arnprior-clears-police-officers,0.75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Holz hit Severight and left the young Indigenous man to die in the road. A Manitoba provincial court judge agreed to a joint recommendation by lawyers and sentenced Holz to 30 months in prison. A rare case of a killer cop being charged, and an even more rare outcome that would see a killer cop do time in prison.</p> The court heard that Holz met other police officers for drinks at a bar starting before 5 PM on the evening of October 10, 2017. He drove off from a nearby car park around three hours later. Investigators calculated Holz was driving at up to 92 km/h in a 50 km/h zone. He hit Severight, who was crossing the street with another person, while going at least 76 km/h. According to the Court, Severight was launched across the road, his skull fractured and his neck broken in the collision.</p> Despite clearly striking someone, Holz did not stop or attempt to help the victim. Instead he continued to drive on, even increasing his speed up to 129 km/h. Almost 12 minutes after striking Severight, Holz parked and called police, saying he had hit someone. A breathalyzer test was done on Holz more than an hour after he struck Severight.

Kalubi, who was arrested by Montreal police in his own neighborhood of Hochelaga, was declared dead less that 12 hours after his arrest.</p> Little information has been released publicly. Police say Kalubi was stopped by officers in Hochelaga and arrested on an outstanding warrant after police ran a background check. The BEI has not stated publicly what the outstanding warrant was for, only that it involved a municipal offense.</p> Community activists in the city, which has seen many cases of lethal police violence against civilians, and disproportionately against Black people, are raising concerns about Kalubi’s death and the actions of police. Racial profiling and so-called carding, where people are stopped by police and subjected to interrogation and/or background checks, have been strongly condemned by community members in cities across Canada. Carding goes hand in hand with profiling as Black people are disproportionately stopped for carding checks in Canadian contexts. Kalubi is of Congolese background.</p> Montreal police reportedly took Kalubi to the station, where he spent the night before being transferred to the municipal courthouse in Old Montreal to appear before a judge, according to the BEI. The transfer took place at 7:35 AM. Only a little more than an hour later, at 8:55 AM, a guard noticed that Kalubi was on the floor and appeared to be unconscious. He was then taken to the hospital and declared dead at 9:55 AM. Community members are raising concerns that Kalubi was subjected to differential, discriminatory, treatment because of histories of police racism in Montreal. The family, for its part has not raised the issues of racial profiling. According to the family’s lawyer, Virginie Dufresne-Lemire: “For the moment, there’s not enough information to know if it’s a case of racial profiling, but with a young black man arrested it can look like racial profiling” (quoted in MacArthur 2017).</p> Dan Philip, the executive director of the Black Coalition of Quebec has said publicly that it took police seven hours to notify his mother and family of Kalubi’s death. Even then, police took the opportunity to  first interrogated the family about Kalubi, before telling them he was dead, according to Philip. Said Philip, in an interview with CBC News: “They felt it was a travesty. They felt there was no compassion. They felt that there was no concern about either the death of the young man or the family themselves who have to mourn the situation” (quoted in MacArthur 2017).</p> Community advocates have little confidence that the BEI will provide satisfactory answers to the family’s many questions. Critics have long pointed out that the BEI includes several former police officers among its active members.  As Philips suggests: “It’s the police investigating the police. They have no interest in finding out why did he died and what negligence caused his death” (quoted in MacArthur 2017). It has also been pointed out repeatedly that the BEI lacks any meaningful diversity. It is expected that their report will not be released for another year yet.</p> &nbsp;</p> Further Reading</p> MacArthur, Cecilia. 2017. “After a Young Man Dies in Custody, a Family Searches for Answers.” <em>CBC News</em>.

In Canada as in the United States Black people are disproportionately killed by police, though less attention is given to lethal police violence in Canada compared with the US. On June 22, 2018, Olando Brown, a thirty-two-year-old Black man, a father with an 11-year-old daughter, died during an arrest by police in the town of Barrie, Ontario.</p> The arrest took place around 2:30 PM near the Tim Hortons donut shop at the Five Points hotel in downtown Barrie. According to witnesses Brown was tased multiple times by Barrie police officers. Questions are being asked why he was not given immediate medical attention rather than being processed by Barrie police. Brown went into medical distress while being booked by police at the police station. He was pronounced dead at hospital. The Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that investigates cases of police harm to civilians in Ontario, is examining Brown’s killing.</p> The violence inflicted by police against Black people in Canada has long been disproportionate. The killing of Olando Brown, a Black man, must be placed within this context. Olando Brown’s aunt, Barbara South, says her nephew was known as someone who would always lend a helping hand and suggests that he would have never died in custody if he was white. She is very clear in her assessment of what police did to Olando Brown:  “My nephew was murdered. There’s no doubt about that” (quoted in CTV 2018).</p> A cellphone video taken by a witness shows officers physically confronting Brown and using tasers to take him down. The person holding the camera says Brown was trying to lay down and had already been hit with a taser. Brown is seen getting off the ground, where he appears to be punched and hit with a taser again. Witness Lance Freeman reports: “They asked him to see his ID and before he even had a chance to pull his ID out, the one guy just kicked him, (and) the other guy just starting Tasing him,” said Lance Freeman, who witnessed the arrest” (quoted in CTV 2018).</p> A man, who identifies himself only as a longtime friend of Olando Brown is among those asking questions about police actions. In his words:</p> &nbsp;</p> “I knew him personally and he was a very kind person, like he would give the shirt off his back. It&#8217;s an unfortunate situation and he didn’t deserve it. To be honest with you, I don’t know the incident. All I know is apparently the cops came down on him when he was over there (behind the bushes behind Tim Hortons) and that’s the story. From that it was just Taser after Taser after Taser. I kind of had faith in the police here because this was supposed to only happen in America, not here. It shouldn’t happen anywhere, but you only see things like that on the U.S. news, but here especially in small-town, nice Canada, it&#8217;s not right.” (quoted in Gibson 2018)</p> &nbsp;</p> Brown’s friend asks why medical attention was not given following the multiple deployments of taser:  “What is the protocol when you Taser someone and especially after that many? Why wasn’t he just taken to hospital for a check-up? He would have been in handcuffs, he wasn’t going anywhere and the police could have seen if he was OK and then processed him” (quoted in Gibson 2018).</p> He also noted the over-policing of people in that area of Barrie.

The last time I saw him he came to my house and he gave me some money for my baby ‘cause my daughter’s in the hospital” (quoted in Grabish 2019).</p> Marjorie Cochrane raised Randy after adopting him.

Taking it hard” (quoted in Grabish 2019).</p> She too has important questions for police: “What happened when they handcuffed him?” (quoted in Grabish 2019).</p> A witness, Will Couture, says Cochrane, rather than being a threat, appeared to be shouting for help while running from something or someone (2019). Couture reports that the man, kept repeating “help me, help me” (Grabish 2019). He then saw police chase Cochrane across the street.</p> Couture claims that the man looked “freaked out.” In his words: “Just scared. Just like terrified of something you know what I mean?

2020-10-07,MR_178,Anthony,Aust,Unspecified,23.0,Male,Black,ON,Ottawa Police Service,Fall,Dynamic Entry,KillerCopsCanada,https://killercopscanada.wordpress.com/2020/10/08/use-of-discredited-dynamic-entry-by-ottawa-police-results-in-death-of-23-year-old-oct-7-2020/," Anthony Aust, a 23-year-old Black man, fell to his death from a twelfth-floor apartment after Ottawa police used a so-called dynamic entry, a tactic identified by courts as showing disregard for Charter rights. Police used the dynamic entry while executing a drug raid, according to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines cases of police harm to civilians, in the morning of October 7, 2020.</p>    It has not been reported publicly what happened after police entered the apartment, what police did, or how long they were there before the victim fell. It has been reported that other people were present inside the apartment at the time of the raid, including younger siblings, mother, grandmother, and stepfather, but not whether they sustained any injuries.</p>    Dynamic entries are akin to the infamous “no knock” raids familiar  in the United States. Masked officers break into a building, often deploying “distraction devices,” such as flash grenades, with guns drawn. While legally required to knock and announce their presence as police, this is not always done (Yogaretnam 2020)</p>    On February 11, 2020, Superior Court Justice Sally Gomery ruled, with reference to another drug raid case, that police use of dynamic entry is “serious misconduct” (Yogaretnam 2020). In her decision she concluded:</p>    “The knock-and-announce principle has been part of Canadian law for decades. The officers who testified did not say when the Ottawa police decided that dynamic entry should be the rule rather than the exception. However long the practice has been in place, it reflects a casual disregard for charter rights.” (quoted in Yogaretnam 2020)</p>    She denied blanket justifications for the use of dynamic entry based on police claims of “officer safety.” In her words:</p>    “This does not justify systemic use of dynamic entry to execute all, or almost all, search warrants of private dwellings in Ottawa. The police cannot operate from an assumption that they should break in the door of any residence that they have a warrant to search. The court must be concerned about disassociating itself from this practice.” (quoted in Yogaretnam 20200</p>    Police have since said that regardless of this finding they will continue to use the practices and clearly have done so.</p>    While few details related to the death have been released publicly, this seems to be another fatality in the statist war on drugs. Decriminalization is essential, not still more police violence.</p>    Three investigators and one forensic investigator have been assigned to the case by the SIU.</p>    </p>    Further Reading</p>    Yogaretnam, Shaamini. 2020. “Ottawa Police Used Controversial Entry Tactic Before Man Fell to His Death, SIU Investigating.” October 7. <a href=""https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/siu-investigating-after-man-falls-to-death-during-drug-warrant-execution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/siu-investigating-after-man-falls-to-death-during-drug-warrant-execution</a></p> ",Anthony Aust,1580_KCC,Ottawa,,,,,TBD,,None,No,No,No,No,No,TBD,https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/aust-family-hires-lawyer-as-siu-continues-probe-into-man-who-jumped-after-police-raid,0.7916666666666666,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RCMP said they dealt with a “lengthy barricaded situation” starting at around 7 p.m.  They were called to a home because of concerns for a man and his partner’s well-being, with officers saying he had “numerous” firearms on him.  RCMP said the man barricaded himself in the house and refused to co-operate with police. Police said they tried other ways to get the man to emerge from the home, and when he did, a “confrontation occurred” and an ERT member fired their weapon, injuring the man.  He was declared dead on the way to the hospital, according to​ police.  No officers or other people were injured. Steve Samano thought it was a joke when his friend phoned him to let him know about the police presence in his neighbourhood.  “We saw the police right there and the SWATs very close, just only 50 metres away or 30 metres away in our backyard,” he said. “We turned off our lights because we [didn’t] have [any] idea of what’s going on outside,” added Mark Samano.  Scott Tunkin lives in the area and said officers were in full tactical gear, focusing the bulk of their work in the alley.  “It wasn’t a whole lot going on until about 1 a.m.,” he said. “We saw them taking formation. Then it was a little after 2 a.m. the ambulances and everything else were here.”  Tunkin said the house’s residents are renters who have lived there for 18 months and had frequent visits from bylaw officers.

Cross was killed when a Pontiac G6 plowed into his car on the city’s Vanier Parkway, throwing him and a 21-year-old woman from the vehicle. The woman was  seriously injured. The driver of the G6 died in hospital eight months after the crash. The two officers had chased the G6. They have never been named publicly.</p> Now the <em>Ottawa Citizen</em> has gained access to a letter sent to Ottawa’s police chief, Charles Bordeleau, by the head of the Special Investigations Unit (SIU), the agency that examines police harm to civilians, offering a stern rebuke of the two officers and raises significant questions about the training that police officers receive and the transparency of investigations into police.</p> &nbsp;</p> The “Old Boys” Letter</p> The letter from SIU head Tony Loparco to Chief Bordeleau, states that the police chase “clearly” broke Ottawa Police Service policy and “likely also ran afoul” of the provincial regulations that govern police chases, specifically of Ontario Regulation 266/10 under the Police Services Act (Shaw 2017). Additionally, the letter points out that the two officers were “long overdue” for their driver training (Shaw 2017).</p> Notably the letter was dated April 21, 2017, which was about a month <em>before</em> the two officers were cleared of any wrongdoing by the Special Investigations Unit, the very unit that is raising these issues and reporting them, not publicly but only to the chief of the officers’ force. This raises deep concerns and questions about the transparency of the SIU, its insiders practices and friendly relationships with the forces it is supposed to be independently investigating, favoritism toward killer cops, and the lack of public accountability for police and for the SIU.</p> This letter was only obtained through the efforts of the <em>Citizen</em> and its filing of a freedom of information request. Loparco’s concerns about the force were not communicated publicly, only to police, and did not seem to inform the SIU assessment of the officers’ actions or the SIU’s decision to let them off, odd given the issues raised by the SIU’s own director in his letter.</p> &nbsp;</p> The “Investigation”: Chasing Training</p> Four SIU investigators and two forensics investigators were assigned to the case. They interviewed nine civilian witnesses and five witness police officers. On May 17, 2017, thirteen months after the crash, the SIU absolved the two officers of even any suggestion of wrongdoing. Said the SIU news releases at the time: “There is no basis whatsoever to hold either of the two subject officers responsible for the terrible outcomes of the motor vehicle collision” (Shaw 2017).</p> Yet, this finding is in complete contradiction with Loparco’s own review and assessment of the officer’s actions in this case as communicated to Chief Bordeleau. Loparco’s letter states that, if not for a senior officer calling off the chase, the two officers could have been in criminal jeopardy and this was a “pursuit that never should have occurred” (Shaw 2017).</p> According to the Ottawa Police Service, its Suspect Apprehension Pursuit policy was developed in conjunction with provincial guidelines that all Ontario police services must follow (Laucius 2017). All officers involved in pursuits are required to have successfully completed a course in pursuit driver training which is approved by the Ontario Police College and they must complete refresher training every two years (Lauicius 2017). Yet the two officers in this case did not follow the policies. Said Loparco, in his letter: “It is my hope that as Chief of the Ottawa Police Service, you will revisit the training that these two subject officers have received” (quoted in Shaw 2017). Yet, really, what does it matter if police disregard policies leading to the deaths and injuries of multiple civilians if they face no negative consequences for their actions?</p> &nbsp;</p> Questions</p> It is still not known why one officer made the decision to try to stop the Pontiac G6 around 1:15 AM that morning. All that has been said publicly is that it was for “licensing and regulatory” reasons (Shaw 2017). There was no criminal offence suspected. Yet Ottawa police policy <em>only</em> allows for chases <em>in criminal cases</em>, and a handful of other restrictive conditions (Shaw 2017). The officer who initiated the pursuit was not conducting a criminal investigation and already had the license plate number for the G6. Loparco noted that the Ottawa police list of requirements for engaging in a pursuit includes:  “an identified criminal offence; no other alternative for apprehension; a threat to public safety; the vehicles involved in the pursuit are marked and the police officers involved have successfully completed police college driver training and refresher every two years” (Lauicius 2017). The first officer even radioed for assistance leading another officer to join the chase. A road sergeant had to make two calls for the officers to end their pursuit.</p> In Loparco’s words, the road sergeant insulted the officers from charges but he does not say why since the officers <em>did</em> initiate and pursue a chase improperly. Said Loparco:</p> &nbsp;</p> “I commend him for his commitment to public safety. I am also hopeful that the officers under his command appreciate that his directions insulated them from criminal jeopardy in these circumstances. Their imprudent actions could well have grounded dangerous driving or criminal negligence charges if they had persisted in a pursuit that should never have happened in the first place.” (quoted in Laucius 2017)</p> &nbsp;</p> Here is the thing. The fact that the chase was initiated in “the absence of a criminal investigation,” as Loparco notes in his letter, means, by definition, that the two officers in pursuit broke both their own force’s rules, as well as possibly violating provincial police chase regulations as established in the Police Services Act.</p> Why did SIU head Loparco raise these serious issues privately with the chief of the force involved, but never publicly? Why did Loparco identify these serious violations yet absolve the officers in spite of his knowledge, beforehand, of these violations?</p> While the SIU director often sends a background letter to the chief of police in the jurisdiction where the incident occurred, outlining any concerns the director has about the case, after a case ends, this letter was sent beforehand.</p> &nbsp;</p> Conclusion</p> Where there are questions about a police officer’s actions under terms of the Ontario Police Act, a police chief or a victim’s family member can request an investigation by the Office Of Independent Police Review Director (OIPRD). This office is responsible for receiving, managing, and overseeing public complaints about police in Ontario (Laucius 2017).</p> At present, there is no legislative mechanism for the SIU to notify OIPRD about concerns it has regarding  misconduct or neglect of duty involving police (Laucius 2017). In consultations with Court of Appeal Justice Michael Tulloch, who led a recent review of police oversight in Ontario, it has been recommended that the SIU be made a “direct complainant” to OIPRD or the Ontario Civilian Police Commission (Laucius 2017).</p> This case offers some important insights into the nature of police “oversight” in the Canadian state context.

The inquest investigated the October 2012 death of Paul Kayuryuk. The jury determined that he died of natural causes after medical care was delayed, because he was held in jail overnight on the assumption he was drunk.    Coroner's inquests do not determine who was at fault for a death, but they can make recommendations to prevent similar deaths in the future.  Kayuryuk was found unconscious at the landfill in Baker Lake and was taken into custody by RCMP, ""based on some level of assumption and some evidence he was intoxicated,"" the jury's written verdict said.    Over the course of the night, the verdict said three guards monitored Kayuryuk more frequently than normal, ""each with an increasing level of concern,"" because of his unconscious state.  By midday the next day, a medical examination was ordered based on information received from the family and concern from the guards.  Kayuryuk was diabetic and the doctor and nursing staff at the local health centre quickly determined he was experiencing a serious stroke.  He was medevaced to Winnipeg, where the prognosis was not good. He died in Winnipeg two weeks later from complications of the stroke.
