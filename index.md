# Data Normalization & Classification: Highlighting Racial Disparities in Police Violence

### Workshop by June Skeeter

## Content Warning:
This workshop deals with a difficult and painful subject that may be triggering to some people.  The datasets we're using today describe incidents of police killings in Canada and the United States.  We are focusing on police violence today because GIS is a powerful tool that can be used to promote social and ecological justice.  Today, we are using this data to emphasize the importance of data nomralization and highlight how different data classification methods impact the ways we percieve information.


# Land acknowledgement

Before beginning the workshop, we'd like to acknowledge the indigenous lands where we are located.    

I am speaking to you today from the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), səl̓ilwətaɁɬ təməxʷ (Tsleil-Waututh), Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Temíx̱w (Squamish) Nations.

Since some of you are spread around the continent, let's take a moment to explore [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) so that you can visualize the indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.
