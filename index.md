# Data Normalization & Classification: Highlighting Racial Disparities in Police Violence

### Workshop by June Skeeter

## Content Warning:
This workshop deals with a difficult and painful subject that may be triggering to some people, especially BIPOC individuals.  The datasets we're using today describe incidents of police killings in Canada and the United States.  We are focusing on police violence today because GIS is a powerful tool that can be used to promote social and ecological justice.  Today, we are using this data to emphasize the importance of data normalization and highlight how different data classification methods impact the ways we perceive information.


# Land acknowledgement
Before beginning the workshop, its important to acknowledge the indigenous lands where we are located.  I am speaking to you today from the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Coast Salish Peoples including the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), səl̓ilwətaɁɬ təməxʷ (Tsleil-Waututh), Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Temíx̱w (Squamish) Nations.

Since some of you are spread around the continent, let's take a moment to explore [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/) so that you can visualize the indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.

# Learning Outcomes
1) Investigate how data normalization impacts the way we perceive patterns in a dataset.

2) Look at different data classification methods and how they impact the way we perceive patterns in a dataset.

3) See an example of how Open Source GIS can be applied to social justice issues.
 
# Definitions
**Data normalization:** The process of scaling one variable by another.  Normalization alows us to highlight patterns in one variable that may be masked that varibles correlation with another.  

**Data Classification** Methods of grouping data into smaller numbers of classes so they are easier to interpret.  The choice of classification method can have a drastic impact on how we percieve a data set and should be carefuly considered.

**Open Source GIS** GIS tools and software that are freely availble online.  Open source technology is more accessible than proprietary tools like ArcPro, making them useful tools for individuals and organizations that lack the resources of large institutions like UBC.
