# Canadian Police Violence Data


This data was collected by the CBC and is available for download [here](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/fatalpoliceencounters/)
    
* "There is no government database listing deaths at the hands of the police available to the public in Canada, so CBC News created its own. The CBC’s research librarians have collected detailed information on each case, such as ethnicity, the role of mental illness or substance abuse, the type of weapon used and the police service involved, to create a picture of who is dying in police encounters. "
    
    
* This is not an official count because police departments in Canada are not mandated to collect all of this information.  Rather this dataset is a collection of second hand information in the form of press releases, news articles, etc.  Some records are incomplete, and the total number of incidents is likely higher than detailed here.

# 1) Police killings by year
* There were 556 killings between January 2000 - June 2020
    * Increasing trend of 0.85 killings/year.
    * 2020 is on pace to be a record breaking year.

# 2) Age distribution of victims

Histograms show the shape and spread of a dataset.
* Here we see the age distribution of victims in 5 year increments.
    * The youngest was 15 and the oldest was 77
    * The mean age is 35.6, the standard deviation is 11.6
* The histogram shows us that the age is slightly skewed towards older ages
    * The distribution has a tail

# 3) What type of weapon (if any) did the victim have?
* Nearly 30% of victims were unarmed.
    * Note - Being Armed is does not justify any individual police killing.
    * However, in aggregate a higher number of killings of unarmed people can indicate a predisposition towards excessive use of force.
