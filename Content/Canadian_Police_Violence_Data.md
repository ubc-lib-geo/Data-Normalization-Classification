# Canadian Police Violence Data


This data was collected by the CBC and is available for download [here](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/fatalpoliceencounters/)
    
* "There is no government database listing deaths at the hands of the police available to the public in Canada, so CBC News created its own. The CBCâ€™s research librarians have collected detailed information on each case, such as ethnicity, the role of mental illness or substance abuse, the type of weapon used and the police service involved, to create a picture of who is dying in police encounters. "
    
    
* This is not an official count because police departments in Canada are not mandated to collect all of this information.  Rather this dataset is a collection of second hand information in the form of press releases, news articles, etc.  Some records are incomplete, and the total number of incidents is likely higher than detailed here.

# 1) Police killings by year
* There were 556 killings between January 2000 - June 2020
    * Increasing trend of 0.85 killings/year.
    * 2020 is on pace to be a record breaking year.

# 2) Age distribution of victims

Histograms show the shape and spread of a dataset.
* Here we see the age distribution of victims in 5 year increments.
    * The youngest was 15 and the oldest was 77
    * The mean age is 35.6, the standard deviation is 11.6
* The histogram shows us that the age is slightly skewed towards older ages
    * The distribution has a tail

# 3) What type of weapon (if any) did the victim have?
* Nearly 30% of victims were unarmed.
    * Note - Being Armed is does not justify any individual police killing.
    * However, in aggregate a higher number of killings of unarmed people can indicate a predisposition towards excessive use of force.

# 3) The racial breakdown of police killings.
* The majority of police killings are white people
    * The second largest demographic is "Unknown", which in most cases means the this information was not recorded by the police.  Since this data was collected and reported by a third party rather through a central database, information is missing.  This information should be mandatory for police departments to collect and publish.
* Demographic groups are not evenly represented in the populations
    * Canada is about 73.4% White while its only 4.7% Indigenous and 3.4% Black

### Think about how comparing at the total killings for population groups of very different sizes might impact the way you perceive patterns.  Using this chart, what demographic group do you think is most likely to be killed by the police in Canada?

This shows different patterns in the data that are easy to overlook when using raw counts
* Nearly half the people killed by BC RCMP did not have a weapon
    * Vancouver Police are the fourth most likely to kill an unarmed person.  Nearly 40% of their victims are unarmed.
    * Killing of unarmed people by police in our region is a severe problem.
    
# This information should be widely known and available.  The RCMP and other Police Services across Canada need to be held accountable.
