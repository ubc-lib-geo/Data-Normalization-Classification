# Canadian Police Violence Data


This data was collected by the CBC and is available for download here: 
    https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/fatalpoliceencounters/
    
* "There is no government database listing deaths at the hands of the police available to the public in Canada, so CBC News created its own. The CBCâ€™s research librarians have collected detailed information on each case, such as ethnicity, the role of mental illness or substance abuse, the type of weapon used and the police service involved, to create a picture of who is dying in police encounters. "
    
    
* This is not an official count because police departments in Canada are not mandated to collect all of this information.  Rather this dataset is a collection of second hand information in the form of press releases, news articles, etc.  Some records are incomplete, and the total number of incidents is likely higher than detailed here.

# 1) Police killings by year
* There were 556 killings between January 2000 - June 2020
    * Increasing trend0.85 killings/year.
    * 2020 is on pace to be a record breaking year.

    * The mean age is 35.6, the standard deviation is 11.6
* The histogram shows us that the age is slightly skewed towards older ages
    * The distribution has a tail

# 3) The racial breakdown of police killings.
* The majority of police killings are white people
    * The second largest demographic is "Unknown", which in most cases means the this information was not recorded by the police.  Since this data was collected and reported by a third party rather through a central database, information is missing.  This information should be mandatory for police departments to collect and publish.
* Demographic groups are not evenly represented in the populations
    * Canada is about 73.4% White while its only 4.7% Indigenous and 3.4% Black
