# Python is a powerful programming language that is free to download and use.
* If you want your own installation, check out [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
  * It will install most commonly used python packages and set everything up for you.


### GIS w/ Python: Resources:

* A great place to go if you're having issues with python is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
	* Its a popular forum where you can search, post, and answer coding questions.
* A related site that is more GIS focused site is [Stack Exchnage](https://gis.stackexchange.com/)


# Python relies on a series of packages (aka libraries) to handle different tasks

* Packages are collections of code that are designed specifically for performing different tasks, e.g.: Plottoing, Statistics, Linear Algebra, etc.


## We'll be workng with the following packages today
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
	* Numpy is a powerful math libary for multidimensional data
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
	* Pandas is a powerful library for handling data
* [geopandas](https://geopandas.org/)
	* This is a geospatial extension to pandas.  We'll use it to handle and manipulate our geospatial data
* [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/)
	* Scipy is math library, we'll use it for calculating a linear regressions
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html)
	* Matplotlib is a powerful ploting library.  We'll uses it to make detailed maps and graphs
* [folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/quickstart.html#Getting-Started)
	* Folium is a webmapping library that interaces with leaflet.js
* [branca](https://python-visualization.github.io/branca/colormap.html)
	* A package for creating colormaps
* [geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
	* This is a package that can connect us with different geodocing services

### We'll be using a UBC server with python alread installed.  It has **Almost** every package we need already installed on it.
* If you are doing this using your own instalaition, you'll need to make sure you install each of the above packages.  Instrctons can be found on each packages webpage
* geopy isn't installed on this server, but we can easily install it ourselves!  I'll walk you through the process on the getting started page.
