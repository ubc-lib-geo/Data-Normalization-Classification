# The United States Data
 
The United States Data is colected by a colaboration of researchers and data scientists and is availble for download here: https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/

"We believe the data represented on this site is the most comprehensive accounting of people killed by police since 2013. Note that the Mapping Police Violence database is more comprehensive than the Washington Post police shootings database: while WaPo only tracks cases where people are fatally shot by on-duty police officers, our database includes additional incidents such as cases where police kill someone through use of a chokehold, baton, taser or other means as well as cases such as killings by off-duty police."

This is not an official count.
* This dataset is a collection of second hand information in the form of press releases, news articles, etc.
* Some records are incomplete, and the total number of incidents is likely higher than detailed here.
