# Data Normalization

Normalization, is the process of scaling (AKA Normalizing) one number by another:
* ie. To find get the proportion of Canada's population made up by each racial group, we need to know:
     * A) The population of each racial group
     * B) The total population
  * Dividing A by B, tells the percentage of Canada's population each demographic group makes up.

Comparing the Proportion of Police Killings for each demogrpahic group to their respective proporion of the population is informative
* However, its more meaningful to combine the police killings and population into one statistc: ###The Police Killing Rate (PKR)
  * The PKR is the number of police killings per unit of population (ie. million) per unit of time (ie. year)

Canada's Total Police Killing Rate is: 
<!-- \begin{align} -->

$$\ PKR = (\frac{Total Police Killings}{Total Population}) x (\frac{1,000,000 ppl}{19.5 yr})$$

<!-- \ PKR & = (\frac{Total Police Killings}{Total Population}) x (\frac{1,000,000 ppl}{19.5 yr})$ \\ -->
<!-- \end{2align} -->






# 3) The racial breakdown of police killings.
* The majority of police killings are white people
    * The second largest demographic is "Unknown", which in most cases means the this information was not recorded by the police.  Since this data was collected and reported by a third party rather through a central database, information is missing.  This information should be mandatory for police departments to collect and publish.
* Demographic groups are not evenly represented in the populations
    * Canada is about 73.4% White while its only 4.7% Indigenous and 3.4% Black

### Think about how comparing at the total killings for population groups of very different sizes might impact the way you perceive patterns.  Using this chart, what demographic group do you think is most likely to be killed by the police in Canada?

# 4) Which police departments are responsible for the most killings?
Here are all departments which have killed at least ten people in the last 20 years.
* Provincial police services and large municipal police departments are responsible for the most deaths
* The RCMP serves as the provincial police in eight provinces and the territories.
    * All together, the RCMP is responsible for 34% of deaths

This shows different patterns in the data that are easy to overlook when using raw counts
* Nearly half the people killed by BC RCMP did not have a weapon
    * Vancouver Police are the fourth most likely to kill an unarmed person.  Nearly 40% of their victims are unarmed.
    * Killing of unarmed people by police in our region is a severe problem.
    
# This information should be widely known and available.  The RCMP and other Police Services across Canada need to be held accountable.
