# Data Normalization

Normalization, is the process of scaling (AKA Normalizing) one number by another:
* ie. To find get the proportion of Canada's population made up by each racial group, we need to know:
     * A) The population of each racial group
     * B) The total population
  * Dividing A by B, tells the percentage of Canada's population each demographic group makes up.

Comparing the Proportion of Police Killings for each demogrpahic group to their respective proporion of the population is informative
* However, its more meaningful to combine the police killings and population into one statistc: ###The Police Killing Rate (PKR)
  * The PKR is the number of police killings per unit of population (ie. million) per unit of time (ie. year)

Canada's Total Police Killing Rate is:
