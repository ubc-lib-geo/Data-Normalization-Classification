# Data Normalization

Normalization, is the process of scaling (AKA Normalizing) one number by another:
* ie. To find get the proportion of Canada's population made up by each racial group, we need to know:
     * A) The population of each racial group
     * B) The total population
  * Dividing A by B, tells the percentage of Canada's population each demographic group makes up.

Comparing the Proportion of Police Killings for each demogrpahic group to their respective proporion of the population is informative
* However, its more meaningful to combine the police killings and population into one statistc: ###The Police Killing Rate (PKR)
  * The PKR is the number of police killings per unit of population (ie. million) per unit of time (ie. year)

Canada's Total Police Killing Rate is 0.81 killings per million residents per year

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math= (\frac{556 Police Killings}{35,151,728 ppl}) x (\frac{1,000,000 ppl}{19.5 yr}) = 0.81">


\begin{align}
\ PKR & = (\frac{556 Police Killings}{35,151,728 ppl}) x (\frac{1,000,000 ppl}{19.5 yr})$ \\
\end{2align}
