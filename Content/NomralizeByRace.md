# Racial Disparities

Systemic Racism is pervasive on both sides of the border

* The police violence dataset and census for each country use different demographic groupings
    * We'll compare the police killing rates of three demographic groups: White, Black, and Indigenous because they are in both datasets.
        * Whites are the majority in both countries, while black and indigenous people disproportionately impacted by police killings on both sides of the border.
* One Caveat, the race of the victim is unknown for 24% of Canadian and 10% of United States.
    * This adds uncertainty to the comparison.  It also means that the Police Killing Rates by race are underestimated, especially for Canada

# Systemic Racism in Policing

* Scaled, to their respective populations, we can see that Indigenous and Black people are much more likely to be killed by the police than white pople in both Canada and the United States
* The overal rates for each race are higher in the US than Canada
    * However the dispartiy between races is actually greater in Canada than the United States
    
* To show this, we can divide the black and indigenous rates fore each country by the white rate.
    * This will tell us how many times more likely a black or indigenous individual is to be killed by the police than a white individual in each country.
    * We can see that Indigenous and Black Canadians are 5.8 and 4.4 times more likely to be killied by police than a White Canadian
        * These disparities are higher than in the US
            * By this metric, you could suggest that police in Canada may be more racially biased than police in the US

# Systemic Racism in Policing is a Canadian Problem

This issue isn't restricted to America, it's pervasive in Canada as well and can not be overlooked. 

* The RCMP were created by Prime Minister John A. Macdonald.  He got the idea for the Mounties from the Royal Irish Constabulary, a paramilitary police force the British created to keep the Irish under control.  Initially called the "North West Mounted Rifles", their primary purpose to clear Indigenous people off their land.  The name was changed to "North-West Mounted Police" because officials in the United States raised concerns that an armed force along the border was a prelude to a military buildup.  This organization was renamed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 1904.
