# Part 2) Comparing to the United States  

There are more police killings in the United States than in Canada

* What factors do we need to look at to compare police killings between Canada and the United States?

* The United States has ten times the population of Canada.  If we don't acount for that, our comparsion wont make any sense
    * The graph below is comparing two countries with very different populations and two datasets with different periods of record.
